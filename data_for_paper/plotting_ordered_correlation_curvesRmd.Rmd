In this report we plot the ordered correlation coefficients of both genders together.
```{r all features correlation by ragion}
all_names <- c(q2_q4_features_names,
q1_q3_features_names,
equal_probability_mixture_names)

Volume_features <- all_names[grep('Volume',all_names)]
Mean_MD_features <- all_names[grep('Mean MD',all_names)]
Mean_FA_features <- all_names[grep('Mean FA',all_names)]
Weighted_mean_FA_features <- all_names[grep('Weighted-mean FA',all_names)]
Weighted_mean_MA_features <- all_names[grep('Weighted-mean MD',all_names)]
```

```{r compute correlations per subgroup}
Volume_features_correlation_matrix <- computeCorrelationMatrix(Volume_features, T)

```
