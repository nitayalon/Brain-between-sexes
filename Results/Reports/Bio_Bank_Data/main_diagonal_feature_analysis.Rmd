In this report our goal is to examine the features found on the main diagonal of the $p-q$ plot.
```{r main diagonal features, include=FALSE}
i <- sample(upper_main_diagonal_feature_names,1)
brain_feature <- results.list[[i]]
```

```{r histogram and CDF}
hist(brain_feature$feature_residuals$value, 
     breaks = 100,
     main = sprintf("Histogram of %s", upper_main_diagonal_feature_names[1]),
     xlab = "value")
plot(ecdf(brain_feature$feature_residuals$value), main = "CDF")
```
